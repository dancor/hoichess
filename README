HoiChess is an xboard compatible chess engine. It is written in C++ for
GNU/Linux, but should work on most other Unix like systems. Since version
0.2.4, HoiChess also fully supports Win32 platforms.

HoiChess was written by Holger Ruckdeschel <holger@hoicher.de>, with some
contributions by other people (see "Acknowledgments" below).

See http://www.hoicher.de/hoichess for more information and new releases.



Acknowledgments
---------------

Special thanks go to Jim Ablett and Dann Corbit for their contributions and
help in connection with the Win32 support.

Special thanks also to Leo Dijksman, for his bug reports and help in testing
HoiChess in hard tournament life.



Documentation
-------------

Currently, the only existing documentation is a Unix man page, which is
included in the source distribution of HoiChess. This man page is also
available in HTML format as hoichess.6.html in both the source and the
Win32 distributions.
